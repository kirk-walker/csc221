**Scripting**

- Echo <message> will allow a script to print to the screen then give us a 
  listing of what is in our current directory.

- the first line in a script tells the system which interpreter to use.
- #! is the shebang that will give the path to the interpreter
- which <program> tells us where our interpreter is located

- ./ tells the system to look in our current directory

- chmod 755 <scrpt> will ensure you have the right permissions

- when we refer to a variable we must place ($) before the name.

- $0 name of the script
  $1-9 any command line arguments given to the script
  $# how many command line arguments were given to the script

- to save the output of a command we us the back tick (`)

- You can also use scripts to back up your projects easily
- make scripts generic and flexible. The more reusable your scripts are
  the less work you have to do.

- date will print the date

- if [] then else fi = perform basic conditional logic
