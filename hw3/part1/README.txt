Your lab directory is: C:\Users\Customer\csc221\hw3

Inside your lab directory, you must create these directories:

 assigning
 aureously
 disaccommodation
 disanoint
 mafoo
 phylacterize
 reallots
 snying
 tapirine
 undarned

For example:

$ cd C:\Users\Customer\csc221\hw3
$ mkdir assigning

These directories are random words chosen based on your username.

Each file in your lab directory (e.g. file00006) contains a list of
random words, but each one contains one instance of each of the random
words you used to create your directories.

Each file must be placed in the directory whose name is contained in
the file.

E.g. if the word "assigning" is in the file "file00006", then you must move
that file "file00006" into the directory "assigning".

$ cd C:\Users\Customer\csc221\hw3
$ mv file00006 assigning
